### Background

This is a Django application called Django Boards, based on Vitor Freitas' Django Boards application in his tutorial series called "A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django" from 2017. When I came across it, I thought it would be great for my technical documentation portfolio to refactor/update the application to 2024 standards and code, as well as add my own features to it. To learn more about my refactoring of this application, please visit my personal site [mariadcampbell.com](https://www.mariadcampbell.com) and search for [How to create a fullstack application using Django and Python Table of Contents](/blog/how-to-create-a-fullstack-application-using-django-and-python-table-of-contents) in the Search bar.

### Purpose

The purpose of this site is to provide a place for Django developers or developers interested in learning how to develop Django Applications get together and share knowledge. However, if you want to visit a seasoned site dedicated to Django development as well as the development of Django itself, please visit the official [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com).

### What do I have to do to register?

When you register, you will be asked to provide a username, email address, and password. If you provide a real email address, you will be notified of your successful registration, and you will also be able to reset your password. If you do not provide a real email address, none of the aforementioned will be possible.

### Are there user avatars?

When you register, you do not upload a user avatar. However, you will be provided with a default one. Once you login, you can go to your My Profile page and upload your own, which will replace the default.

### Is there Markdown support?

This side does not have a Markdown editor. You have to add your own Markdown styling to topic post content. The basics are covered:

Available tags:

a

abbr

acronym

b

blockquote

code

em

i

li

ol

strong

ul

s

sup

sub

### Is this an established forum?

No. It is a very new site. If you want to engage in an established Django Forum, you can visit the official Django Project's [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com).
